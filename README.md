Documentation Location
-----------------------
Documentation describing my solution is located here:
[https://github.com/lengebretsen/szhomework/blob/master/design/schoolzilla_homework_design.pdf]

Proof of Concept Project
-------------------------
I have also created a simple proof of concept application that demostrates transforming CSV files according to JSON mapping files.

The project is located in the src directory and can be built by running:
    mvn clean install
    
A good starting place for exploring the PoC is the main unit test located at:
[https://github.com/lengebretsen/szhomework/blob/master/src/test/java/org/schoolzilla/homework/TranslatorTest.java]

Also check out the main Translator class here:
